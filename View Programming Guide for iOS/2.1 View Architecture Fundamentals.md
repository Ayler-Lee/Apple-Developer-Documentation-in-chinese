Most of the things you might want to do visually are done with view objects—instances of the UIView class.  
大多数表面上你想做的事已经被 UIView 类的实例对象做完了.

A view object defines a rectangular region on the screen and handles the drawing and touch events in that region.  
一个视图对象定义了屏幕上的一个矩形区域, 在这个区域里处理绘画和触摸事件.

A view can also act as a parent for other views and coordinate the placement and sizing of those views.  
一个视图也能做为其它视图的父视图, 并协调这些视图的位置和大小.

 The UIView class does most of the work in managing these relationships between views, but you can also customize the default behavior as needed.  
UIView 类在管理视图间的关系上做了大量工作, 不过你还是可以自定义你需要的默认行为.

Views work in conjunction with Core Animation layers to handle the rendering and animating of a view’s content.  
视图与核心动画层一起工作来处理一个视图内容的渲染和动画.

Every view in UIKit is backed by a layer object (usually an instance of the CALayer class), which manages the backing store for the view and handles view-related animations.  
 UIKit 中的每个视图都被一个层对象(通常是 CALayer 实例对象)支持, 它为视图管理后台存储和处理视图相关动画.
 
Most operations you perform should be through the UIView interface.  
你执行的大多数操作应该通过 UIView 接口.
  
However, in situations where you need more control over the rendering or animation behavior of your view, you can perform operations through its layer instead.  
然而, 在你需要更多控制在你的视图的渲染或动画行为上, 你能通过它的层(layer) 执行操作.

To understand the relationship between views and layers, it helps to look at an example.  
 为了理解视图(views)和层(layers)的关系, 举个例子.

Figure 1-1 shows the view architecture from the View Transitions sample application along with the relationship to the underlying Core Animation layers.   
图片 1-1 显示了来自[ViewTransitions]()的示例应用的视图结构与底层核心动画层的关系.

The views in the application include a window (which is also a view), a generic UIView object that acts as a container view, an image view, a toolbar for displaying controls, and a bar button item (which is not a view itself but which manages a view internally).   
这个应用中的视图包含了一个窗口(也是一个视图), 一个一般的 UIView 对象做为容器视图, 一个图片视图, 一个显示控件的工具条, 和一个条形按钮项目(它并不是一个视图,而是在内部管理一个视图).

(The actual ViewTransitions sample application includes an additional image view that is used to implement transitions. For simplicity, and because that view is usually hidden, it is not included in Figure 1-1.)  
(真正的`ViewTransitions`示例应用包含另一个图片视图用来实现转场. 为了简单, 而且它通常都是隐藏的, 所以没有在 Figure1-1中显示.)

Every view has a corresponding layer object that can be accessed from that view’s layer property. 
(Because a bar button item is not a view, you cannot access its layer directly.)   
每个视图有一个对应的层对象, 通过视图的 layer 属性获得.(因为条形按钮项目不是一个视图, 你不能直接获得它的 layer 属性.)

Behind those layer objects are Core Animation rendering objects and ultimately the hardware buffers used to manage the actual bits on the screen.  
层对象背后是核心动画渲染对象并最终用于管理屏幕上的实际位(actual bits?)的硬件缓冲区.

The use of Core Animation layer objects has important implications for performance.    
核心动画层对象的使用,对性能有重要的影响.

The actual drawing code of a view object is called as little as possible, and when the code is called, the results are cached by Core Animation and reused as much as possible later.  
一个视图对象实际的绘画代码尽可能少的调用, 当代码被调用, 结果被核心动画缓存, 之后会被尽可能多的复用.

Reusing already-rendered content eliminates the expensive drawing cycle usually needed to update views.  
复用已被渲染的内容忽略了通常需要更新视图的昂贵的绘图周期, .

Reuse of this content is especially important during animations, where the existing content can be manipulated.  
复用这些内容在动画时尤其重要, 在现有的内容可以被操控的过程中.

Such reuse is much less expensive than creating new content.  
这些复用比起创建新内容花销小得多.
