In addition to providing its own content, a view can act as a container for other views.   
除了提供自己的内容外, 视图可以作为其他视图的容器.

When one view contains another, a parent-child relationship is created between the two views.  
当一个视图包含另一个视图, 这两个视图之间就有了父子关系.


The child view in the relationship is known as the subview and the parent view is known as the superview.   
子视图叫subview, 父视图叫 superview.

 The creation of this type of relationship has implications for both the visual appearance of your application and the application’s behavior.  
这种关系的创建对于你应用的可视化外观和应用程序的行为都有一定的影响.

Visually, the content of a subview obscures all or part of the content of its parent view.  
看起来, 子视图的内容挡住了父视图的全部或一部分区域.


If the subview is totally opaque, then the area occupied by the subview completely obscures the corresponding area of the parent.   
如果子视图是完全不透明的, 这被子视图占据的部分挡住了父视图相应的区域.

If the subview is partially transparent, the content from the two views is blended together prior to being displayed on the screen.  
如果子视图是部分透明的, 两个视图的内容在显示之前会混合(blended)在一起.

Each superview stores its subviews in an ordered array and the order in that array also affects the visibility of each subview. 
每个父视图在一个有序的数组里存储它的子视图, 数组中的序列同时也影响子视图的可见性.

If two sibling subviews overlap each other, the one that was added last (or was moved to the end of the subview array) appears on top of the other.  
如果两个同级的子视图重叠在一起, 后添加(或被移动到数组末尾)的视图会在上面.

</br>

The superview-subview relationship also impacts several view behaviors. 
父子视图关系同样影响几个视图的行为.

Changing the size of a parent view has a ripple effect that can cause the size and position of any subviews to change too. 
改变父视图的尺寸会产生涟漪效应, 这会引起子视图大小和位置的改变.

When you change the size of a parent view, you can control the resizing behavior of each subview by configuring the view appropriately.  
当你改变父视图的大小的时候, 你可以通过适当配置视图控制每个子视图调整大小的行为.

Other changes that affect subviews include hiding a superview, changing a superview’s alpha (transparency), or applying a mathematical transform to a superview’s coordinate system.
其他影响子视图的改变, 包括隐藏父视图, 改变父视图的透明度,或应用一个数学转换父视图的坐标系统.

</br>

The arrangement of views in a view hierarchy also determines how your application responds to events. 
视图在层级中的排序同样决定了你的应用如何响应事件.

When a touch occurs inside a specific view, the system sends an event object with the touch information directly to that view for handling.  
当一个特定视图发生触摸事件时, 系统直接发送一个带有触摸信息的事件对象到这个视图.

However, if the view does not handle a particular touch event, it can pass the event object along to its superview.  
然而, 如果这个视图没有处理这个特定事件, 它会把这个事件传递到它的父视图.


If the superview does not handle the event, it passes the event object to its superview, and so on up the responder chain. 
如果父视图没有处理这个事件, 事件会被传递到它的父视图, 沿着响应链一次类推.

Specific views can also pass the event object to an intervening responder object, such as a view controller.  
特定的视图也可以传递事件对象到一个中间应答器, 例如一个视图控制器.


If no object handles the event, it eventually reaches the application object, which generally discards it.  
如果没有对象处理事件, 它最终会到达应用程序(application)对象.
