## 2.2.1 The Relationship of the Frame, Bounds, and Center Properties


**Frame, Bounds, Center 属性之间的关系**

A view object tracks its size and location using its frame, bounds, and center properties:  
一个视图对象用它的 frame, bounds 和 center 属性追踪它的尺寸和位置:  

* The frame property contains the frame rectangle, which specifies the size and location of the view in its superview’s coordinate system.    
frame 属性, 包含了矩形框架, 它指定了视图在父视图中的尺寸和位置.  

* The bounds property contains the bounds rectangle, which specifies the size of the view (and its content origin) in the view’s own local coordinate system.   
bounds 属性, 包含了矩形边界, 它指定了视图在自己坐标系中的大小(和内容原点)

* The center property contains the known center point of the view in the superview’s coordinate system.   
center 属性, 包含了视图在父视图中的中心点.

</br>

You use the center and frame properties primarily for manipulating the geometry of the current view. For example, you use these properties when building your view hierarchy or changing the position or size of a view at runtime. If you are changing only the position of the view (and not its size), the center property is the preferred way to do so. The value in the center property is always valid, even if scaling or rotation factors have been added to the view’s transform. 

The same is not true for the value in the frame property, which is considered invalid if the view’s transform is not equal to the identity transform.  
你用 center 和 frame 主要用于操作当前视图的几何形状. 例如, 你用这些属性当你构建你视图的层次结构或在运行时更改一个视图的位置或大小. 如果你只改变了视图的位置(而没有改变大小), center 属性会是更好的方式. center 属性的值总是可用的, 即使缩放或旋转因子被添加到视图的形变中. frame 属性的值同样是不正确的, 它被认为是无效的, 如果视图的形变不等于identity transform.

</br>

You use the bounds property primarily during drawing. The bounds rectangle is expressed in the view’s own local coordinate system. The default origin of this rectangle is (0, 0) and its size matches the size of the frame rectangle. Anything you draw inside this rectangle is part of the view’s visible content. If you change the origin of the bounds rectangle, anything you draw inside the new rectangle becomes part of the view’s visible content.

Figure 1-5 shows the relationship between the frame and bounds rectangles for an image view. In the figure, the upper-left corner of the image view is located at the point (40, 40) in its superview’s coordinate system and the size of the rectangle is 240 by 380 points. For the bounds rectangle, the origin point is (0, 0) and the size of the rectangle is similarly 240 by 380 points.

Although you can change the frame, bounds, and center properties independent of the others, changes to one property affect the others in the following ways:

* When you set the frame property, the size value in the bounds property changes to match the new size of the frame rectangle. The value in the center property similarly changes to match the new center point of the frame rectangle.  

* When you set the center property, the origin value in the frame changes accordingly.  

* When you set the size of the bounds property, the size value in the frame property changes to match the new size of the bounds rectangle.  


By default, a view’s frame is not clipped to its superview’s frame. Thus, any subviews that lie outside of their superview’s frame are rendered in their entirety. You can change this behavior, though, by setting the superview’s clipsToBounds property to YES. Regardless of whether or not subviews are clipped visually, touch events always respect the bounds rectangle of the target view’s superview. In other words, touch events occurring in a part of a view that lies outside of its superview’s bounds rectangle are not delivered to that view.
