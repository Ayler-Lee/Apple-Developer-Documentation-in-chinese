One of the benefits of having a layer object behind every view is that you can animate many view-related changes easily. Animations are a useful way to communicate information to the user and should always be considered during the design of your application. Many properties of the UIView class are animatable—that is, semiautomatic support exists for animating from one value to another. To perform an animation for one of these animatable properties, all you have to do is:

1. Tell UIKit that you want to perform an animation.
2. Change the value of the property.  

每个视图后面都有一个 layer 对象的好处就是, 你可以很简单地给视图做动画. 动画是一个很好的方式来和用户沟通, 在设计程序时应该多考虑动画. UIView 类的很多属性都是可以动画的, 半自动地支持从一个值到另一个值. 为了执行这些属性的动画, 你要做的就是:

1. 告诉 UIKit 你要执行动画.
2. 改变属性的值.

Among the properties you can animate on a UIView object are the following:
你可以在给 UIView 对象进行动画处理的属性如下:

`frame`—Use this to animate position and size changes for the view. (位置和尺寸)  

`bounds`—Use this to animate changes to the size of the view. (尺寸)  

`center`—Use this to animate the position of the view. (位置)  

`transform`—Use this to rotate or scale the view. (旋转和缩放)  
  
`alpha`—Use this to change the transparency of the view. (透明度)  

`backgroundColor`—Use this to change the background color of the view. (背景色)  

`contentStretch`—Use this to change how the view’s contents stretch. (内容拉伸)

One place where animations are very important is when transitioning from one set of views to another. Typically, you use a view controller to manage the animations associated with major changes between parts of your user interface. For example, for interfaces that involve navigating from higher-level to lower-level information, you typically use a navigation controller to manage the transitions between the views displaying each successive level of data. However, you can also create transitions between two sets of views using animations instead of a view controller. You might do so in places where the standard view-controller animations do not yield the results you want.  

当一组视图从一个场景转换到另一个场景时, 动画执行的地方很重要. 通常情况下, 你可以使用视图控制器来管理与界面之间的重大变化相关的动画. 例如, 涉及从高级别到低级别的信息, 通常你会用一个导航控制器来管理视图之间展示每个数据级别之间的转场. 你也可以自定义一个转场动画来替代控制器. 你可能会在标准视图控制器动画效果你不满意的的地方这么做.

In addition to the animations you create using UIKit classes, you can also create animations using Core Animation layers. Dropping down to the layer level gives you much more control over the timing and properties of your animations.  
除了 UIKit 类的动画之外, 你也可以用核心动画层(Core Animation)创建动画. 用更底层的框架给你动画的时机和属性更多的控制.
